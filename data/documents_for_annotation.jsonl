The author isn't writing on an academic site (possibly a quack), but does raise some good points about the limits of stealth aircraft and warships against peer opponents. Specifically, he mentioned the effectiveness of phased radar against stealth aircraft and ineffectiveness of radar-absorbing-materials against frequencies they weren't designed to absorb. \n For those who have more understanding of stealth technology, is he actually right about cost effective countermeasures to stealth aircraft? Given that the US has invested heavily in stealth technology, while other powers are either far behind, or have a tertiary focus on stealth (Eurofighter) is he right to say that it's not cost-effective?", "meta": {"subreddit": "CredibleDefense", "existing_conspiracy_label": "No"}}

There's a lot here, much of it will be familiar to people on this sub but it's probably the most expansive single article that I've seen on these bizarre problems with the social justice left.  \n Before the usual suspects come in and start whining about how \"there are LITERAL NAZIS marching on the streets!!!\" Or, \"but what about the EVIL TRUMP REGIME'S latest CRIME???\": Yeah those people are assholes and objectively worse than a 20 year old college student ranting about ableism. However, as this article points out, the intersectionality movement appears to be damaging to coalition movements which might oppose Trump, white supremacists, etc.   \n I see no easy way of convincing a 65 year old Sean Hannity fan that Trump isn't worth voting for again, but it it seems obvious that the young social justice radicals are probably having a negative effect on younger voters, moderates, and coalitions.", "meta": {"subreddit": "samharris", "existing_conspiracy_label": "No"}}

The Labor Department said Thursday that the number of claims increased from 658,000 the week before. Though the pace of applications has dropped sharply since early this year, they remain high by historical standards: Before the pandemic flattened the economy a year ago, jobless claims typically ran below 220,000 a week. Still, the four-week average of claims, which smooths out week-to-week gyrations, fell by 10,500 to 719,000 — the fewest since mid-March 2020, just before the pandemic began to cause widespread layoffs.

They are gearing you up to say it's Cliamte Change due to humans, it isn't. \n Here's a few that are overdue: \n -The Pacific NW is past due for massive flooding and earthquakes. \n That cheerful orange stripe is known as the Cascadia Subduction zone. It's a fault line, where one part of the Earth enters the other. Most of the time, this happens smoothly, as if Barry White were playing in the background. But every once in a while, our douche of a planet likes to get rough and America rejects the incoming plate. This is called a full-margin rupture, and it's as devastating as it sounds. The last time that happened was in 1700, and the earthquake was so big that it caused a giant tsunami that destroyed a bunch of coastal Japan across the ocean.\nThe Pacific Northwest is all but due for one of these, and it couldn't be more terrifying. When the next one happens, at roughly around a 9.0 (re: very bad) on the Richter scale, cities like Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland are in for what's been described as the worst natural disaster in the history of North America. FEMA projects 13,000 dying, one million homeless, and 2.5 million needing food. Or roughly five to six Katrinas. And that's not even counting Canada. \n -San Francisco's Hayward Fault Gets An Earthquake Every 140 Years ... And It's Been 148 Since The Last One \n -Places like Mumbai Are Going to Flood At Any Moment ...And are way past due \n In a few decades, 11 million people will be at risk for these floods -- or $1.5 trillion, in heartless capitalist terms. And it's not just Mumbai, either -- cities like Chennai are going to have major floods in the next several years, too. \n -The New Madrid Fault May Take Out 150 Miles Of The Midwest \n Way back in 1811 and 1812, when America was still experiencing odd growth spurts and constantly arguing with its mother, a series of over 1,000 earthquakes rocked the Mississippi River between St. Louis and Memphis. One was so powerful that it caused the river to run backwards for a few hours. Another was felt all the way on the East Coast. The epicenter of the quakes was the town of New Madrid, which might as well have been renamed New New Madrid, because it took years to rebuild it. \n Today, the affected cities sit peacefully on the mighty Mississippi -- despite that pesky 40 percent chance that a New-Madrid-level quake could hit in the next few decades. \n \n Earth is due for an “extinction-level” event from the sky \n \n ..and even if we see it coming, we won’t be able to do anything about it, a NASA scientist said Monday. \n Speaking at a meeting in San Francisco, Dr. Joseph Nuth of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center said large asteroids and comets, the type that could wipe out civilization, are extremely rare, but tend to hit “50 to 60 million years apart.” Given that a comet wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, one could argue that we’re slightly past “due.” \n “The biggest problem, basically, is there’s not a hell of a lot we can do about it at the moment,” he added. \n \n We are overdue for a massive Tsunami/Earth quake  to strike the US \n \n A natural disaster of titanic proportions is overdue to strike the U.S., physicist Michio Kaku warns. \n Seismologists predict it will be the worst natural disaster in North American history, and the federal government estimates it could contribute to 13,000 deaths and 27,000 injuries. \n \"It's not a question of if, it's a question of when,\" the City University of New York physics professor said Thursday on \"CBS This Morning.\" \n \n New York, which is actually riddled with faults, has a long history of earthquakes: On average, the region has witnessed a moderate quake (about a 5.0 on the Richter scale) every hundred years.

Previously, we showed that the MBCS facilitates serine protease-mediated entry into human airway cells (Mykytyn et al., 2021). Here, we report that propagating SARS-CoV-2 on the human airway cell line Calu-3 - that expresses serine proteases - prevents cell culture adaptations in the MBCS and directly adjacent to the MBCS (S686G).
